### Lint.ac is a custom and fully open-sourced anticheat for you to use.
### Lint is advanced, powerful and hard to bypass.

## Detections
### We provide up to ~20% difference in speed, as-well as ~15% difference in jumping height allowing you to catch hackers in record time.
### We also have many checks such as fly, invalid, teleport, etc!
### It is also almost impossible to fly for more than 2 seconds while using Lint! ;)

## Setbacks
### **Lint provides you ability to lag cheaters back to their original position before detections**, which stops them from flying and more.

## Performance
### **Lint is designed to make sure your game or players does not lag while using Lint** and also make sure the anticheat runs on a good performance.
### **Keep in mind, this does not mean Lint is LAG-PROOF.** Lint still may lag your in-game scripts unless configured correctly.
