### Lint is a free anticheat that provides advanced and premium anticheat levels for your game, at any time.
### Lint runs on **1** Server-Sided Script and **1** Module Script inside the Server-Sided Script. It is almost fully server-sided meaning cheaters cannot disable or try to disable the anticheat, protecting your game from full disablers and bypasses.
### By using Lint you comply to our **Terms of Service**.

## Performance
### **Lint is designed to make sure your game or players does not lag while using Lint** and also make sure the anticheat runs on a good performance.
### **Keep in mind, this does not mean Lint is LAG-PROOF.** Lint still may lag your in-game scripts unless configured correctly.

### As with every single other anticheat that exists in this world, there will always be possibilites for false flags and bypasses and **Lint** is like no other. 
### Please remember Lint's purpose. **It is designed to detect blatant cheaters that like to fly and more.**. 
### If you are looking for an anticheat that can detect 1% increase on anything, instantly detects all fly hacks then you are not in the right place. Lint is not the right anticeat for you, 
### and there wont be an anticheat for you.
